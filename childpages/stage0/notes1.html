      <div>
        <div>
          <h5>I learned about block and inline elements</h5>
          <p>  
            All elements are boxes. Block elements get displayed alonein their own line, inline elements however share the line with anything that is there to share it. 
            <br>Some block: 
          </p>
          <p> &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  </p>
          <p> &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  </p> 
          <p> &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  </p>      
          <br>
          <div>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</div>
          <div>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</div>
          <div>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</div>      
        </div>
        <div>
          <p> 
           Some inline <span>&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</span> or <b>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</b> or 
           even the <img src="img/image.png" title="like an image tag - image" alt="how to make an image in html">. 
           <br> &lt;br&gt; is also an inline tag, although it shows on the next line
          </p> 
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>Tags can be void or have content. </h5>
        <p>
          When they have content they keep it within the opening and the closing tags
         <br>&lt;***&gt; : opening tag 
         <br>content : content 
         <br>&lt;/***&gt; : closing tag    
         <br>
         <br> Void tags come with one tag only. &lt;img&gt; or &lt;br&gt;. They finish within themselves.
        </p>
      <div>
      <div>
        <p>
         I learned also that html is a semantic language and this is why the &lt;b&gt; tag is not the best tag to indicate importance <br>
         the &lt;strong&gt; tag is to be used, the b proprieties are more to do with css. <br>
         The strong tag indicates what type of text it is, and not how it should be. Then html tells the browsers what type of text or data it is.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          and also i think that &lt;b&gt;&lt; looks like a little shark!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1 title="well now i also learned this"> &lt;b&gt;&lt; <h1>
