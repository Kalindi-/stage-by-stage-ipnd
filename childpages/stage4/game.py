# here are all my definitions.

terms1 = { "BIT" : "basic unit of information, can have only one of two values:\
				0/1, yes/no, True/False, +/-, on/off ...",

		  "URL" : "Human readable address of a webage that translates to a numerical IP Address \
		  		Steve Huffman said: 'the location of the physical machine which has the document \
		  		we want to fetch.'",

		  "SERVER" : "It is the software that accepts and responds to requests about the data that is \
		  		stored on it. It is also the machine running the software responsibile for storing and \
		  		communicating. They wait to get instructions on what to do. The http \
		  		instructions that I learned a bit about are POST and GET. When it gets a \
		  		POST request it updates the information on itself, whereas when it gets a GET \
		  		request, it goes to fish out the info and delivers it to the asker.", 	

		  "BANDWITH" : "Bits per second.",

		  "GET" : "parameters put in url - used for fetching data - maximum url lenght \
				- ok to cache - no change server",

		  "POST" : "parameters put in body -used for updating data on servers - no max len \
		  		- not ok to $ - can change server",
		}

terms2 = { "KITTY" : "miao",

		   "NETWORK" : "Nodes and their connecting links, enabling communication between the nodes.\
				Among computers they allow data exchange. Data is transferred in the form of packets \
				sent and delivered to a specific node address.",

		  "IMPORTANCE OF VALIDATING INPUT - Programmers side" : "When a programmer allows (outdside) \
		  		input to a program (or website), he must make sure that the input is of the wished for \
		  		type, but especially that it is not going to mess up with the original code. Thus \
		  		inputs have to either be made safe by escaping, or by checking if the input is what it \
		 		supposed to be. An interesting case of this is maybe signing in, where the input \
		 		is compared to couples of values ont the server, if they match, you are in.",

		  "IMPORTANCE OF VALIDATING INPUT - Users side" : "It can help the user to have a smoother \
		  		experience, by checking and responding weather the input is what it was meant to be \
		  		(a number, a month...). It can also give feedback as to which element they need to \
		  		revisit by returning the page with info on the reason for the invalid input. Another \
		  		reason is if the input contains code characters it could mess up with the program, and \
		  		it is possible that it is not what the user wanted.",

		   "HTML TEMPLATES" : "They are awesome, copies of pages can be made in thousands, \
		  		by collaging the pre-defined parts together and reusing them over and over agai, \
		  		whitout the need to rewrite code each time.\
		  		They allow adding and styling of content, that we do not know yet at the time of \
		  		page making (for ex. user inputed content), by just predefining space for it. It \
		  		one of the difference between web apps, and static web pages." ,

		  "TEMPLATES AND ABSTRACTION" : "We go one more step further away from constructing \
		  		the pages step by step, but we create concepts, or page sections, or things based \
		  		on how they function. We define each section once, and then we can use it as much \
		  		and whenever we want it through a simple call. Awesome because it makes thinking \
		  		about pages more functional."
