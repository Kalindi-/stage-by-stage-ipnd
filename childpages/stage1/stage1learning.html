						<!-- is there a better way to make such titles (with rounded background) or is this ok? -->
					</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							As I started to programme a little, especially in the topic of website creation,
							this brought me thoughts of blind website users, and this caused quite a few understandings.
							<br>For example, it is nice to give imgages a title, so that a description can express what is there.
							<br>
							<br>My new exciting discovery these days is that through html elements we need to 
							explain how is the text on a page, what kind of text it is.
							<br>This way &lt;h1&gt; expressess importance, and not only that it should be bigger and bolder.
							<br>It expresses characteristics of its content.
							<br>
							<br>I heard the word <em>semantics</em> being used among these topics these days, 
							but i don't understand it much, so i ll just leave it here.

						<mark class="pagetitle">Style</mark> 
					</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							We can style our elements, not one by one, but by combining them in different ways.
							Either through their parent group, or by different tags we assign them (for example: class or id).
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS helps us with that. 
							<br>We can make one CSS file that we use across all the different html pages, 
							(but it sure needs discipline).

					<h2> 
						<mark class="pagetitle">Semantics</mark> 
					</h2>
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							Here I am back to write a bit more about semantics.
							<br>Certain HTML elements have been included into html5 to increase its semanticisity.
							This means that they try to express what is inside them, instead of just saying
							how they should look. (example &lt;b&gt; exchanged for &lt;strong&gt;,
							because the second one explains more). One should take care to name ones
							classes also in a semantic manner, thus what is its role, its meaning,
							and not its looks. Some semantic elements now are &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;,
							&lt;article&gt;, and they've been chosen by looking into which classes people used the most.

					<div class="text">
						<p>
							There are some neat <strong>developer tools</strong> in Chrome:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li> Inspect element
									<ol>
										<li>can <em>move around</em> to see all the elements inside</li>
										<li>can <em>click around</em> to see the characterisitics of different elements</li>
										<li>can change these characteristics or elements</li>
										<li>and see how the changes look like right away</li>
									</ol>
							</li>
							<li> Then one can save the page as website</li>
							<li> it can also make you see how the page looks on a phone</li>
							<li> awesome </li>

					<h2>
						<mark class="pagetitle">Something about trees </mark>
					</h2> 
					<div class="text">
						<p>
							Websites have a tree like structure
							<br>which means that there are parent elements that contain other elements 
							and can themselves be contained by even "bigger" ones.
							<br>
							<br>On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure" >wikipedia</a> 
							they have really many visual representations of how tree structures interact.
						</p>
						<div class="minibox">
							<figure class="image">
								<img src="img/notes2image1.png" alt="wikipedia image of html structure">
								<figcaption>
									The html structure is closest 
									<br>to this interpretation (except 
									<br>here it misses closign tags
								</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<br>
							<figure class="image">
				 				<img src="img/notes2image2.png" alt="wikipedia image of websitelike structure">
				 				<figcaption>
				 					The structure visible on websites
				 					<br>is similar to this one (science
				 					<br>should also have its own box)
				 				</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</div>
						<p>
							It is interesting how this nested elements interact or what does it actually mean.
							<br>Some elements inherit characterisitcs, some elements divide the space.
							<br>The DOM - Document Object Model - defines how these elements are represented, 
							and how they interact. But i dont really understand what the DOM is, maybe next time.
							<!--The DOM is how the browser begins to render the webpage. It takes the elements you've defined and makes nodes, parent and child nodes, as it reads through your page. This link gives more details on the DOM: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction. got this from reviewer, must think about it-->
							<br>I ll keep an eye out, to try to make more concepts relating to the Tree structure clearer to me : )
